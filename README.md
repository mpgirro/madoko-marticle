# madoko-marticle

marticle = the madoko-article

Madoko template, with a few tweaks here and there, for writing general purpose documents, especially when you have collegues who prefere to get documents in a more MS Words like style. Designed for A4 page sized PDFs.

See `document.mdk` for usage example.
